# OnlineBench
OnlineBench is a simple internet speed benchmark based on speedtest.net CLI by Ookla
Please refer to https://minigameking.net/onlinebench/ to download and how to use.
Version 1.0. Requires Speedtest.net's windows CLI version 1.0.0 to work
This is NOT a standalone benchmark and needs to have the files of the CLI in the same directory as the batchfile.

# ErrorCodes

OnlineBench can also display some error codes when not started properly.

Error code 0001 means that the files of speedtest.net are not present in the same directory(speedtest.exe and speedtest.md). The script requires these core files to function.
Please check if everything in the directory is set correct

Error code 0002 means that theres no internet connection found on the pc it has been run at.
To fix it the computer HAS to connect to the internet to test the speed of the connection.


#Note To Ookla
OnlineBench is an opensource script that improves the Speedtest CLI. It doesnt redistribute ANY files other than the script. It does require the files to be present, but since im only making the script run on-top of the non edited file it is in no direct contact with speedtest and/or other trademarked files/names. Software made by ookla is directly downloaded from ookla themselfs and my software is directly downloaded from minigameking.net/onlinebench. These statments can also be found on my websites download page of OnlineBench.
